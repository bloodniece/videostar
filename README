This is the sansculotte vj patch written in puredata dataflow.

It is based around two channel joystick control.
There is a clip based and a generative/automatic aspect to it,
both can be combined to avoid obvious repetition.

it has been developed from 2010 on and it is based on an earlier
program that translated joystick control into MIDI signals.

requirements:
- pd-extended
- a video-card that supports GLSL
- usb joystick (or ps2 jyostick with a usb-adaptor)

installation:
- in [pd init] set the paths to match your system
- in videodir.pd set/add the subfolders of your video_dir
   - the setting "init_banks" in [pd init] is the number of subdirectories

runtime_configuration:
- open [joystick] and select the correct hid device for each slot
